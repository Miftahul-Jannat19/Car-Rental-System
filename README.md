# Car-Rental-System
The project aims to establish a streamlined platform for efficient Car Rental and Ride
Sharing Services, emphasizing seamless management and regulation. The focus will
be on providing a user-friendly experience for customers looking to rent cars or share
rides, ensuring swift and precise service.

# Motivation:

Our project is driven by a compelling vision to address the challenges faced in a
bustling city like Dhaka, where owning a car has become a necessity. Recognizing that
not everyone can afford to buy a car, we aim to provide both short and long-term
car rental subscriptions that offer access to vehicles for daily and longdistance transit.
Furthermore, we see an opportunity to empower car owners by allowing them to rent
out their vehicles when not in use, thus creating a source of additional income.Although
this innovative concept is not yet widely practiced in our country, its success in India
inspires us to bring this convenient and lucrative solution to our community.
